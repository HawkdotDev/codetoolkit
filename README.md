# Codetoolkit

Codetoolkit is a comprehensive package designed to simplify common coding tasks for developers. It provides a collection of pre-built functions and utilities to streamline data handling, text manipulation, and code optimization, saving developers time and effort.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Functions like `cleanData`, `trimData`, `parseData`, and `standardizeCase` facilitate common data cleaning tasks, such as preparing data for analysis and removing inconsistencies.
  
- **Text Manipulation**: Utilities for common text manipulation operations like `uppercase`, `lowercase`, `trim`, `split`, `join`, `replace`, `truncate`, and `capitalize`, making it easier to work with strings and format text efficiently.
  
- **Data Transformation**: Powerful tools such as `arrayToObject`, `objectToArray`, `mergeObjects`, and `deepClone` enable flexible data transformations, helping developers reshape data structures and simplify complex operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with Codetoolkit, simply install the package using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install codetoolkit
```

Or include it as a dependency in your project's package.json file:
```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "codetoolkit": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

Then, import the desired functions or utilities into your code and start using them right away:

```javascript

const { cleanData, uppercase, mergeObjects } = require('codetoolkit');

// Example usage
const cleanInput = cleanData(userInput);
const capitalizedText = uppercase(text);
const mergedObject = mergeObjects(obj1, obj2);
```

For more detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the documentation.
